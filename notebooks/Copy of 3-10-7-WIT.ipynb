Open up the Male and Female tabs and take a look at their confusion matrices.\n","\n","![sex_confusion_matrices](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1S0Rl583OFtyfgUEhCVdpdxRxhmCyx2mW)\n","\n","5. We see that men are far better represented than women in the dataset (~700 men vs ~300 women). We also see that even out of those 300 women, only 12.5% make over $50K. For men, this rises to 29%. Our model is probably overfitting to the data, and we have a lack of female representation in the dataset to boot.\n","\n","6. So how do we try to make our model more fair? **Let's say we are trying to approve loans based on the income prediction.** One way is to try different threshold optimization strategies for the two groups.\n","\n","7. As a first attempt, let's optimize our thresholds to enforce equal accuracy for men and women. Click on the \"**Equal Accuracy**\" radio button under the Fairness window.\n","\n","![equal_accuracy](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1iEev406OypBLsUyp6SJc4A0Drok66hb1)\n","\n","8. We see that in an attempt to preserve equal accuracy across men and women, the strategy lowered the threshold for women from 0.5 to 0.2, and increased the threshold for men from 0.5 to 0.85. Accuracy for men got slightly better by skewing their results negative; the # of TNs went up, increasing the accuracy, but the # of TPs went down slightly. Skewing the results positive for women resulted in many more deserving women being offered loans (TPs went up) but consequently ballooned the FP rate. This strategy turns out to be unfair to men.\n","\n","9.  Let's try something different; click on the \"**Demographic Parity**\" radio button. This strategy makes sure that if 30% of the applicants are women, then 30% of the approved loans should be women as well.\n","\n","![demographic_parity](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xuau4_OgtQ7tybsfmgFDQ9AXYAsY22kN)\n","\n","8. However this turns out to be unfair to men as well because more non loan-worthy women may turn out to be approved, in order to preserve equal proportions of men and women. This is reflected by the higher # of FPs for women, and the increase in FNs for men.\n","\n","9. So far, trying to enforce equal outcome (either by enforcing equal accuracy or equal proportion) has been resulting in deserving candidates from the more advantaged group to be denied loans (because these strategies skew their results negative). Perhaps we should try to optimize for **equal opportunity** instead, where the same percentage of deserving men and women are given loans, i.e. **the percentage of TPs are the same for men and women**. Now click on the \"Equal Opportunity\" radio button.\n","\n","![equal_opportunity](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1QQP0uU121yeinU6KtEBEONe_tIZaCnTA)\n","\n","10. Here, we observe that the TP rate for men and women is equal (56/202 ~ 11/38). Using this strategy, **deserving individuals, regardless of gender, have an equal chance of being approved for a loan**. This strategy is also the fairest out of all the ones we tried, for this particular dataset. (caveat: strategies for fairness can vary wildly depending on what your dataset looks like and what kind of outcome do you want to achieve!)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z0gW4aguDjHh"},"source":["# Part 3: Learning check\n","\n","### Use the questions below to self-evaluate your learnings!\n","\n","1.
